# Introduction to Blockchains

This repository contains the material for our [Introduction to
Blockchains](https://blockchain-course.org) course.

You can take the course online at
[blockchain-course.org](https://blockchain-course.org/).

## Installation

This installation needs a database to function correctly. Any database will do.
We provide here instructions for setting up and using
[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/).
- If you don't have a (Postgres) installation, install `postgresql` using your
  package manager (e.g `sudo apt install posgtgresql`) and follow the [generic
  instructions](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/First_steps) or the ones
  specific to your distribution (e.g.
  [Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PostgreSQL),
  [Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-18-04))
  to initialize the database cluster, start the database server and create a
  user. After this step, you should be able to create databases with your normal
  user account.
- Create a datatbase with the name of your choice, owned by your normal user
  account. With Postgres, you can achieve this with `createdb <db_name>`.
- Create an [OAuth
  App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/)
  on Github
    - Development:
      - Homepage URL: http://localhost:3001/
      - Authorisation callback URL: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/github/callback
    - Production:
      - Homepage URL: https://blockchain-course.org
      - Authorisation callback URL: https://blockchain-course.org/api/auth/github/callback
- `cd api && cp .env-template .env`
- Add your OAuth App client ID and secret as provided by GitHub to the
  respective variables in `.env`.
- `cd ../db && cp .env-template .env`
- Add your username in the respective placeholders in the first variable of `.env`.
    - _Note_: The default database name is set to `blockchain_course`. If you
      prefer to give it a different name, change the name in `install.sh` and
      `.env`.
- `cd .. && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh`
- In the `app` directory, copy `.env-template` to `.env.development.local` for
  development or `.env.production.local` for production and modify the variables
  accordingly. See more at
  [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables#what-other-env-files-can-be-used).

## Environment variables

### Database

`DB_URI`:  Postgres connection URI. It has the following format `DB_URI=postgres://user:password@host/database`. See more at [Connection URIs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/libpq-connect.html#AEN38680).

`PROVIDER`: An Ethereum provider like [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli). Needed by `SolidityJudge`.

`ASSIGNMENT_FOLDER`: The path of the folder that contains the assignments. Defaults to `db/assignments`.

### API

`GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: Your Github Client ID. See more at [Building OAuth Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/).

`GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Github Client Secret. See more at [Building OAuth Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/).

`GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL`: Authorization callback URL. See more at [
Redirect URLs](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#redirect-urls).

`APP_SECRET`: Session secret. See more at [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session#readme).

`APP_URL`: The URL of the web app.

`PORT`: API server port.

### APP

`REACT_APP_API_URL` = The URL of the API server.

`REACT_APP_LOGIN_URL` = The API login URL.

`PORT`: APP web server port. Needed only for development.


## Assignments

Assignments by default are assumed to be inside `db/assignments`. You can change the location of the assignment folder by setting the environment variable `ASSIGNMENT_FOLDER`.

Each assignment should extend the `BaseJudge` class or the `SolidityJudge` class in the case of the smart contract. The assignments are parameterized for each user and each user has a public and a private aux. Both the public and the private aux are created once (See `db/models/parameterizedassignment.js`).

Each assignment has to implement `judge (aux, user, assignment, solution)` and `aux (user, assignment)` functions. `judge` function takes as input an `aux`, a `user`, an `assignment` and a `solution`, and returns `1` in case of success and `0` otherwise. The `aux` function takes as input the `user` and the `assignment` and return an aux `{ private: 'privateAux', public: 'publicAux' }` where `private` and `public` can be of any type and can be omitted.

### Example

```javascript
const BaseJudge = require('../judge/BaseJudge')
const { sha256 } = require('../helpers')

const PREIMAGE_PREFIX = 'blockchain-course.org:'
const POW_TARGET = 5

class ProofOfWorkAssignmentJudge extends BaseJudge {
  aux (user, assignment) {
    return {
      public: user.id
    }
  }

  async judge (aux, user, assignment, solution) {
    const nonce = solution
    if (sha256(PREIMAGE_PREFIX + aux.public + nonce).substr(0, POW_TARGET) === '0'.repeat(POW_TARGET)) {
      return 1
    }
    return 0
  }
}

ProofOfWorkAssignmentJudge.metadata = {
  lecture: 'cryptographic-primitives',
  name: 'proof-of-work',
  title: 'Performing Proof-of-Work',
  description: `Find a nonce such that the hexadecimal digest of SHA256("${PREIMAGE_PREFIX}" || "%s" || <nonce>) starts with ${POW_TARGET} zero characters`,
  type: BaseJudge.type.TEXT
}

module.exports = ProofOfWorkAssignmentJudge

```
